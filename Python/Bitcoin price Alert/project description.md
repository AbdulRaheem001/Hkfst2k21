This project is self explanatory as the title Bitcoin price alert using python

- This project can be completely executed with the help of bolt iot kit and few python libraries but i have contributed the source code of my project

- This code will simply fetch the bitcoin price and compares it with the selling price fixed by the user and send an sms and activate buzzer connected to the bolt iot device 

- If you have any doubt regarding this code and project please mail me at "guru.vikram.399@gmail.com"
